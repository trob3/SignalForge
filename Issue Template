     If you have a rough idea of the implementation, include it here. -->

## Alternatives Considered
<!-- What other approaches did you think about? Why did you prefer this one? -->

     e.g.
     - [ ] Score output includes severity weighting
     - [ ] Existing test suite still passes
     - [ ] Documented in Scoring.md -->
- [ ]
- [ ]

## SOC Context *(optional)*
<!-- Is this tied to a specific SIEM, detection framework, or workflow?
     e.g. Sentinel, Splunk, MITRE ATT&CK, alert triage SLA -->
